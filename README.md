The idea for this project is to provide GOOD widgets for google calendar

I want widgets that sync with my google calendar. The widget will show the next
3-5 events on my calendar. I want it to stay in sync very quickly, it should 
see newly added events within 1 minute

## Lock screen Widget
a double wide lock screen widget can display 4 lines of text which is enough to show 3-4 
events that would look something like this

```
12:30p  Standup
8:30p   Games w/ Evan
Tomorrow
6:00a   Yoga
```

## Home screen widget
the home screen widget will show the next 4-6 events and retain the color association
defined in Google Calender, displaying as a color background behind the event name

## In App view
The in app experiance will show a full scrollable agenda view, any selection will
open that day or event in the Google Calendar app. Adding an event will open event
creation in the Google Calendar app
